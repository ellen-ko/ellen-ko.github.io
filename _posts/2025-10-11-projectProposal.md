My project is a soft fabric pouch that automatically lights up when opened and adjusts its brightness based on the surrounding environment. Using a snap switch connected to and a light sensor, the circuit detects both when the pouch is open and how bright it is. Two LEDs respond to those inputs: an RGB LED fades smoothly with changing light levels, and a white LED on D10 turns on when the pouch is open but only at a certain brightness input. In bright daylight, both LEDs stay off to conserve power. The LilyPad board will be sewn to the back of the pouch for stability, with conductive thread running along the seams to connect power (+) and ground (–) to each component. The light sensor will be positioned near the pouch opening so it can detect ambient brightness accurately, and the LEDs will be sewn inside the lining to create a soft, diffused glow. Any crossing threads will be insulated with small felt patches, and all knots will be sealed with clear nail polish to prevent fraying. This design combines coding logic, analog sensing, and eTextile sewing into a simple yet refined piece that only glows when it’s truly needed.
