My project is a pouch that has three LEDs on the inside: two white ones that turn off when a certain brightness level is reached; and an RGB LED that turns off with the white light but also has varying brightness levels depending on whether it is dark or dim out. If it is dim or dark out, the lights only turn on when the pouch is open and everytime the pouch is opened and the LEDs turn on, there is a random RGB color. The brightness level is given by a light sensor on the pouch. I have a few tips for my past self: I found that when it came time for me to actually sew, I didn't take into account the fact that the Arduino board would be flipped, as it was on the back side of the fabric and the other components were on the front. This made it difficult for me as I then had to reconfigure the placement of my traces as I was going through the project. Building off of that, I should've made a paper prototype once I realized that the traces had to be moved. I didn't do so at first and ran into a problem where two different traces attached to the light sensor had to cross and I has to insulate the conductive thread by attaching felt so that the circuit wouldn't short circuit. My last tip to myself is
