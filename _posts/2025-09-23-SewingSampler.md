Admittedly, I am now finishing up this assignment at 2:30 AM, way past my bedtime. However, if I were to give past me a bit of advice for this sewing sampler it would be this: actually listen to Professor Howley when she says this will take a long time and that you might want an embroidery hoop. The obvious information aside, I would also say to outline everything out!! A lot of my stitches came out a little funny looking because I didn't outline most of my stitches.
