subtitle: Why I joined eTextiles!
---

I joined eTextiles because I want to learn to sew and turn code/data into something you can touch. It’s fun—and it’s an intriguing design problem: how can software jump off the screen and live on the body? I’m learning the fundamentals: stitching, simple circuits, and Arduino to prototype a responsive wearable that reacts to motion, light, or sound. As someone who has been involved with performing for majority of my life, iy would be interesting to just see this design question play out. Think a stage accessory or safety patch that comes alive in real time.
