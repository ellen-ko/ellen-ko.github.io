This program had me creating two homemade switches out of conductive materials. Essentially, a step up in the Etextiles world as it's no longer just sewing components together using conductive thread but figuring out creative ways to control the circuit. A trick I found helpful while doing this was to continue using alligator clips throughout the process to help with spacial reasoning and making sure that my switches work. Hopefully this isn't the cutest project I make, but take a look:
