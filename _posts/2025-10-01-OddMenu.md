This program pretends to be a restaurant with two different menus: a ragular menu and a secret menu. The trick here is that you only see the secret menu if you give the program an odd number. After that, a second number chooses the dish within the selected menu. As a tip to my past self, I would say to sketch out a table on paper or write out the scenario in plain English and figure out what is changing first and what effect that would have. Here's how I tested this out a couple of times:
