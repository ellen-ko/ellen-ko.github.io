Hi! My name is Ellen and I really do not like olives. I'm a sophomore planning to major in History and Comp Lit. So, I'm a little out of my element with my technology proficiency being limited to what I need while writing essays. Although I did take Intro to Computer Science, I'm not sure how successful that was but it was done nonetheless! I've only ever sewn four times in my entire life and they are as follows: one cross-stitching kit from Michaels when I was in 4th grade and about three more of those. But, I'm so excited to learn how to sew. Sewing has always been one of those skills that I want to learn but never could. So, I'm excited to learn that in this class with the intersection of technology.
