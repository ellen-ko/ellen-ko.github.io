This project essentially step two in combining coding with tangible technology (our Arduino boards)! The program simulates the flashing patterns of three different types of fireflies, at the same time through one cycle. Each firefly's behavior is represented by an LED on the board, the flash bulb with A5, big dipper with A7, and synchronous with 6. A tip to my past self would be to do use state variables and a shared timer instead of separate delays, that way all the lights can act in parallel instead of waiting for each other. But I really enjoyed this assignment! It was a fun with to get comfortable with Arduino and my code worked! Take a look at my board:
