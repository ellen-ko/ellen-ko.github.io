For this assignment, I programmed my Arduino to randomly toggle the built-in LEDs on my LilyPad ProtoSnap Plus using arrays. Every second, the program chooses one LED and checks a parallel array to see whether that LED is currently on or off. If it’s on, the program turns it off; if it’s off, it gives it a random brightness. A tip to my past self would be to make sure I've done the POGILs through before starting the code. Other than that, here's my board:
