This project required a program that turns the on-board RGB LED (pins 12, 13, 14) on with a random color when you press a button. The LED stays that same color the entire time the button is held, and it turns off as soon as you release it. Unfortunately, as I was testing out my program with my board and button, my button started smoking. Which, I do not take to be a good sign. When connecting the button to the board again, the button stopped working. So a huge tip to myself: don't keep your board on as you are fixing your code! Your pieces will start smoking and it will be very scary!
