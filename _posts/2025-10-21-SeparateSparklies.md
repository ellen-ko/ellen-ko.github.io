This project essentially was our first step in combining coding with tangible technology (our Arduino boards). The program simulates the flashing patters of three different types of fireflies. Each firefly's behavior is represented by an LED on the board. The goal was to design and code three independent algorithms. A tip to my past self would be to read through the slides BEFORE doing the assignment, not during...The slides basically covered everything I needed. Here are some oddly cropped photos of my board (I didn't realize my code was in the back):
