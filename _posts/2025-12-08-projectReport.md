My project is a what I call a pocketful of sunshine. It is essentially a pouch that has three LEDs on the inside: two white ones (although it turned out to be one white, one orange because I had already sewn the orange one on before I realized) that turn off when a certain brightness level is reached; and an RGB LED that turns off with the white light but also has varying brightness levels depending on whether it is dark or dim out. If it is dim or dark out, the lights only turn on when the pouch is open and everytime the pouch is opened and the LEDs turn on, there is a random RGB color. The brightness level is given by a light sensor on the pouch. My main motivation for this project came when I was sitting in the '62 Center in a dark auditorium, fumbling around for gum in my purse. I was thinking to myself: I wish there was some sort of light here that isn't my phone but could still be discreet. And thus, the pocketful of sunshine was born! For my project I used:
LilyPad Arduino USB
Conductive thread
White LED
Orange LED
RGB LED
Light sensor
Snap fasteners 
Battery & battery holder
Felt 
Canvas fabric
Alligator clips (for prototyping)
Fabric glue

I have a few tips for my past self: I found that when it came time for me to actually sew, I didn't take into account the fact that the Arduino board would be flipped, as it was on the back side of the fabric and the other components were on the front. This made it difficult for me as I then had to reconfigure the placement of my traces as I was going through the project. Building off of that, I should've made a paper prototype once I realized that the traces had to be moved. I didn't do so at first and ran into a problem where two different traces attached to the light sensor had to cross and I has to insulate the conductive thread by attaching felt so that the circuit wouldn't short circuit. My last tip to myself is to sew the felt onto my fabric first so that the pouch fabric has a little more structure. Without doing so, the pouch wasn't folding in the way that I wanted to, as it did with the paper which had a little more structure, and I found that it made it extremely difficult for me to get the seams right when it came time to sew the fabric together after the electric components were on.
