My project is a soft fabric pouch that automatically lights up when opened and adjusts its brightness based on the surrounding environment. Using a snap switch connected to and a light sensor, the circuit detects both when the pouch is open and how bright it is. I added an additional white LED that would also only turn on at a certain brightness input and reconfigured the placement of some elements. Take a look at my prototype:
