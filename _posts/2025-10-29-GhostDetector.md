This project takes multiple analog sensors to make our Arduino board interact with its surroundings. The program detects when it’s both dark and cold by taking in two inputs, light and temperature, and turns on the red LEDs when those conditions are met. It was really satisfying to see everything working together, since it combined what we learned about light and temperature sensors into one cohesive system. A tip to my past self would be to use the Serial Monitor first to figure out what the “dark” and “cold” thresholds should actually be instead of guessing—it made the process way easier. Overall, this assignment made me feel more confident reading sensor data and controlling multiple outputs at once. Take a look:
