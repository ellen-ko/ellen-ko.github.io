This assignment was done in a slightly more timely manner, done before 2am! This project required me to prototype three LED lights, a button, and a switch with the use of conductive thread. Essentially, it was a beginner project for circuit work, and a test of my patience. A tip to my past self would be this: start this earlier and be prepared for a couple rough tries with the conductive thread. I found that while intially sewing my components onto my felt, the thread kept breaking because I would either cut it too long---and the thread would get tangled---or I would pull on the thread too hard leading to it snapping in my hands. A few tears later, I finally figured it out! So, just be mentally prepared for the thread to be a little annoying. But I now have a derpy little thing that I can proudly say I made! Take a look :)
